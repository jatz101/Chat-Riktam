# Chat-Riktam
NodeJS Chat backend for Riktam Round 2

I have created the basic outlay of the application and have got the logic ready for the admin side of user as well as login and logout for every user. For group side of the application, I have laid out the foundation for the api`s required.

I have made the models for the tables required for implementing this and I have used mongodb as the database.

This is the skeletal structure of the group chat based application.
